This folder is intended as a playground for experimenting with various neural network models and libraries. It contains implementations of 
* mnist_mlp: A simple multilayer perceptron for MNIST implemented with keras
* mnist_cnn: A simple convolutional neural network for MNIST implemented with keras
* usps_cnn: A simple convolutional neural network for USPS dataset implemented with keras
* variational_autoencoder: Two implementations (one in pure Theano, one in lasagne) of the model proposed in
